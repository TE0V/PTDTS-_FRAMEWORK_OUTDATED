DC motor (PAN):
    -given continuous input according to DRV8874 specs
    -angle given by encoder should used primarily for calculations, not as a position
    command for the motor, (i.e. the dc motor should be built around the action of
    first panning to an angle given the encoder steps, but after that it should not be 
    bound by angle but instead try to constantly center the camera on object).
    - For calibration, the system should be turned manually to calculate the exact
    number of steps
Servo (tilt): considering the servo is not currently functional, this featurset will
    be skipped for now.
High Quality Camera (Picamera2(1)): Primary purpose is initial detection. For the sake of the 
    demo, it is also the primary tracking camera. As such, it will be run at as high a 
    framerate as is possible given the raspberry pi constraints. Resolution is 
    inconsequenctial for this demo
Yolo: Main preformance constrain. I will be using NCNN model format given it's steller increase in preformance.
    - THE MOST IMPORTANT OUTCOME of this system is it's ability to track movement in real time, this should come before all.
GUI: web based gui is to contain video output with yolo overlay (center crosshair with line drawn too calculated center of detection box)
    - It should also include an overlay of the calculated angle from center given by the encoder.
    - It should include a manual override for the motor with subsequent live control over the system using the arrow keys
